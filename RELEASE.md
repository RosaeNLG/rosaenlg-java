# Versioning, Releases

**RosaeNLG for Java version numbers are aligned with RosaeNLG main version numbers** (e.g. RosaeNLG for Java 1.20.2 contains RosaeNLG 1.20.2).

RosaeNLG for Java follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- version numbers follow RosaeNLG's main version versioning
- a version is published each time a new version of RosaeNLG exists
- new versions often also contain debug and security updates
- only the last version is maintained (see [Supported Versions](SECURITY.md#supported-versions))
